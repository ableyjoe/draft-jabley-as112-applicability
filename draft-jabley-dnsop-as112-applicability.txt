             Applicability Statement for the AS112 Project
             draft-jabley-dnsop-as112-applicability-latest

Abstract

   The AS112 Project provides infrastructure that is used as a target
   for DNS queries that it is not possible to answer in a useful way,
   such as queries that relate to a private network that are sent to a
   public server.  From time to time IETF protocols specify use of the
   AS112 Project.  This document provides an Applicability Statement for
   the AS112 Project that aims to provide guidance for how and when the
   AS112 Project should be used.

1.  Introduction

   Well, how about this?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terminology related to the Domain Name System as
   described in [RFC8499].

3.  Security Considerations

   Make reference to the existing security guidance.

   Provide guidance on when sinking queries with the AS112 project is
   appropriate, and when it is not.  For example, note that causing
   queries to be redirected to AS112 servers can present privacy risks.

   Note that protocols that intend to cause queries to be sent to AS112
   servers should do so carefully, mindful that excessive traffic being
   sent to any destination can have the effect of denying service to
   both AS112 infrastructure and intermediate networks and systems.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Give IANA directions about how to respond to requests from other
   documents that relate to AS112.

   Note that since there are known cases of protocols that specify that
   queries for particular names in the ARPA domain be redirected to
   AS112 infrastructure, the IANA should start the process of becoming
   equipped to provision DNAME RRSets in the ARPA zone.  Perhaps clarify
   that the provisioning process involves ancilliary systems and
   processes and is not simply a matter of support for the DNAME
   resource record type in the servers that serve the ARPA zone.
